# midterm-toolbox-333

Exercises to prepare for the 333 midterm. You will be expected to be able to use any of these techniques in an interview setting.

The questions on your midterm will be brand new though! Memorizing soltuions to these exercises is NOT enough!

I also strongly recommend re-doing Java Derusting and Java Annealing for extra practice.
